## Automated reconstruction of 3D City Models and using them in urban applications

- **When:** *Sunday, September 30th, 2018*
- **Where:** *TU Delft, Library (Prometheusplein 1, 2628 ZC Delft)*
- **How:** *You can register [here](https://3dgeoinfo.typeform.com/to/G8WwRm). The cost is 40€, paid by credit/debit card.*

### Description

The intention of this workshop is to guide you through the lifecycle of a 3D City Model from concept to creation, manipulation and analysis and provide you with a hands-on experience in the process.

The morning session will start with an introduction to 3D City Models and their implementations: [CityGML](https://www.citygml.org) and [CityJSON](https://www.cityjson.org), and will conclude with the automatic creation of 3D datasets from 2D data and point clouds through [3dfier](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3dfier/wiki).

The afternoon session will focus on the visualisation and manipulation of such models through [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), [Azul](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azul/id1173239678?mt=12) and the Python programming language ([GDAL](http://www.gdal.org) and [cjio](https://github.com/tudelft3d/cjio)). Finally there will be a demo of [Möbius](https://design-automation.github.io/mobius-modeller/), a visual programming environment for creating parametric scripts to generate geometric models with semantics. The workshop is jointly organised by the 3D geoinformation group at TU Delft and Patrick Janssen (of the National University of Singapore and TU Delft).

Lunch and coffee will be provided. Also, after the workshop there will be drinks and snacks.

The workshop fee is €40 and there is a limit of 30 attendees. You can register [here](https://3dgeoinfo.typeform.com/to/G8WwRm). *(Registration form will close as soon as the positions are filled)*
